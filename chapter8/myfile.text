 On a quiet evening, a small boy
 found an old pocket watch buried in the 
 sand near the riverbank, its glass cracked 
 but its ticking stubborn and alive. When he wound it,
   the world around him slowed just enough for him to notice 
   things he had always missed—the way the wind braided the grass,
     the patience in his mother’s eyes, the courage hidden in his own chest.
       He never told anyone about the watch, and one day it stopped for good, 
       but by then he had learned its real gift: time was precious not because it 
       could be controlled, 
but because it could be truly seen.
